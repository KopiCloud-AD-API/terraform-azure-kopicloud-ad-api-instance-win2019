The Terraform code in this repo will deploy an Azure Virtual Machine for **KopiCloud AD API** with Windows Server 2019 and SQL Server 2019 Express.

## Network Configuration

The code will create the network resources (Resource Group, VNET, Subnet).

## Notes

- By default, the download and installation of **SQL Server Management Studio** is disabled because it will take lots of time.

- The default Windows username and password are managed by the **terraform.tfvars** file.

## Configuring Azure Credentials

Read the document **Getting Started with Terraform and Microsoft Azure - Section 6** to configure credentials.
